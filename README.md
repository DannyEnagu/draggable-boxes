# MaterialPro Frontend Technical Assessment

The project is a technical interview assessment for a frontend role at MaterialPro. The project has taught me a lot, especially how to use the HTML drag and drop API. It seems simple but provided me with some tough challenges, like how to center each draggable box under the cursor when it is dropped to avoid dropping the box below the cursor.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
