# MaterialPro Frontend Technical Assessment

This project, a technical interview assessment for a frontend role at MaterialPro, has been a valuable learning experience. I've particularly gained a deeper understanding of the HTML drag and drop API. While it might seem straightforward, it presented some challenging problems, such as precisely centring each draggable box under the cursor upon dropping, preventing it from appearing below the cursor.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
