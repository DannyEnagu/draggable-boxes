# MaterialPro Frontend Technical Assessment

As a technical interview assessment for a frontend role at MaterialPro, this project proved to be quite insightful. I significantly improved my skills with the HTML drag and drop API. Despite its apparent simplicity, it introduced some difficult challenges, notably figuring out how to center each draggable box directly under the cursor upon dropping, rather than having it drop below.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
